2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.
    A database may be used whenever an app requires the longterm storage of related data.  Being able to join 
    tables allows access to lots of inforation in one location.  A text file may be used when the data is being stored on
    your local machine. Or when the data is so simple that the overhead of the database engine isn't worth it.  For instance
    if you are saving a simple list of strings.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
    SQL was created to work with data in a database.  It's a declarative language that only concerns itself with the data
    that needs to be found and not how the database should retrieve the data.  It also allows a mostly stnadardized way of
    interacting with the many differnt datbase engines avaliable today.

4. A database is a binary file that stores tables.  Each table consists of rows and columns.  Data is stored as values
    in the cells of the table.  A cell is accessable by it's row and column indexes.  A database engine creates the 
    binary files and also creates the protocals for data intry and data access.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
    Table: a collection of data stored in rows and columns.
    row: a single horizontal area of a table that combined with columns make up cells to hold a value for the table.
    column: are the verical area of a table that define what the data represents.
    value: a single peice of data stored in a database cell at a given intersection between a row and column.

        datad@comcast.net  |  2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z
    2. SELECT userid
        FROM users
        WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';
        Output:
        userId
        1
    3. SELECT *
        FROM users
        where userid = 4;
        Output:
        userId      name                email                   signup
